        A solid-state drive (<abbr title="solid-state drive">SSD</abbr>) is a solid-state storage device that uses 
        integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of 
        computer storage. It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk, even though 
        SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read–write heads used in hard drives 
        ("<abbr title="hard drives"> HDD</abbr>") or floppy disks. <br>
